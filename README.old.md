# favor-exchange-react-app
The idea behind that application is for people to have a place to share favors. What that means? Nowadays you can see that the humanity have a lot of problems. The main problem is the money problem. Imagine if an old woman needs some force to move a couch in her home or something like that. But that woman have problems with the money. But she can offer for example cooking skills, watching little kids time and etc. In that case she can use that app to make a request for somebody who can move a heavy couch.

I think it is a good open source idea and even if this app helps to 1 person to fix a real problem, for me that is enought to say that the app is great!
